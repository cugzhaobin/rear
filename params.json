{"name":"REAR","tagline":"a Regional ElAstic Rebound Calculator","body":"![](http://hpc.rm.ingv.it/rear/REAR_-_a_regional_elastic_rebound_calculator_files/greenland.png)\r\n\r\nREAR is a simulation tool aimed at computing the response of a solid, non-rotating, elastic, isotropic Earth to surface loading. \r\nREAR has been designed for studying the regional deformation induced by variations of cryospheric loads, and it is optimized for the challenging task of the computation of deformations to high harmonic degrees, which is essential for for the interpretation of geodetic observations in regions subject to small-scale surface mass variations.\r\n\r\nREAR is free software, released under the GPLv3 license. Version 1.0 of REAR and its user manual are available for download [here] (https://github.com/danielemelini/rear/releases).\r\n\r\nÂ© 2014 D. Melini, G. Spada, P. Gegout, M.
